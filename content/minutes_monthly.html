The simple method to post the pdf version of the minutes is at Pages -> Board Minutes- Compiled -> Minutes by Month
<br><br>
Here we can take the same content in the pdf version of the minutes and present it as a web page. The advantage is that it has the look of the website, the content becomes searchable, and it assists screen readers.
<br><br>
The main preparatory step is to copy the pdf content of the minutes and enter it into a plain text document. That document can be checked for formatting irregularities and fixed, then the content can be copied and pasted into the editing box on this page.
<br><br>
Once a page for any given month is created, the page can be viewed and the URL of the page can be copied. The URL is then entered at Pages -> Board Minutes- Compiled -> Minutes by Month and the version of the minutes created here will be available.

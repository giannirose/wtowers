		Editor: This "News" region is for current news and announcements. There are three sections, each led by a light grey "Editor" box. The first section is to announce a meeting, the second is for general news items, and the third is to announce that there is no news. It may look complicated, but work through it and you will see how the the "editor" areas define the published page. There are more notes in the individual editor sections below.<br><br />
		Editor: At the end of this page is a checkbox and textarea message box. If there is no news to report, skip to these, check the checkbox, and fill in a short message.
